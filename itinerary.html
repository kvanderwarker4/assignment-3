    <h1 style="color: #FCC814"><br> Our Itinerary</h1>
    <p><br> We didn't plan our days too much, so we were free to explore what we wanted. Disney does, however, have a Fast Pass and dinner reservation system, so we did plan what day were were going to each park and what times we would vist certain attractions and eat our sit down meal. We also made a point to see certain shows and parades on days that we were in certain parks.</p>
